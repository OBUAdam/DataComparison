# DataComparison
Compares Data

Create these two files and put them in the same folder as the solution file:
* TablesToCompare.supersecret - the list of tables to compare (ex: dbo.Person)
* ConnectionStrings.supersecret - the list of database pairs to compare (ex: Dev,DevServerName,DevDBName,Test,TestServerName,TestDBName)

The results will go in files in a folder called Results.
